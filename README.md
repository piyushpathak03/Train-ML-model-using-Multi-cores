# Train-ML-model-using-Multi-cores

### n_jobs
n_jobs basically used for using the multiple cores at a time for reducing the time and for parallel processing of the machine learning project

### n_jobs = 1 :- 1 core used at a time
### n_jobs = 2 :- 2 core used at a time
### n_jobs = 3 :- 3 core used at a time
### n_jobs = 4 :- 4 core used at a time
### n_jobs = 5 :- 5 core used at a time
### n_jobs = 6 :- 6 core used at a time
so own

### n_jobs = -1 :- All cores used at a time when you don't know the number of cores present in your system.



n_jobsint, default=None
The number of jobs to run in parallel. fit, predict, decision_path and apply are all parallelized over the trees. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.
